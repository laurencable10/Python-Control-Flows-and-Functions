# Python Practice - Iteration, Control Flows, and Functions

## Learning Objectives
 
- Exploring `Python` control flow and conditional programming  
- Implementing `For` and `While` loops to iterate through data structures
- Applying `if, else` conditional statements
- Creating functions to perform repetitive actions.
- Demonstrating error-handling using `try, except` statements
- Combining control flow and conditional statements to solve the classic "FizzBuzz" code challenge.
